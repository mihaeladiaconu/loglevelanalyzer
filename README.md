# loglevelanalyzer
.NET code analyzer for log4net

This project exemplifies how to build a Roslyn code analyzer. 
This example warns developers if logs are not surrounded by if statements.

Project was used as a demo for my ["Building a code analyzer with Roslyn"](https://speakerdeck.com/mihaeladiaconu/building-a-code-analyzer-using-roslyn) presentation at CodeCamp Autumn 2016
